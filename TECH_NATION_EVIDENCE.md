# TECH NATION EVIDENCE  
## Enterprise Risk Intelligence Engine — Applied AI Contribution

**Applicant:** Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera  
**Category Alignment:**  
- Mandatory Criterion (MC)  
- Optional Criterion 2 (OC2): Innovation / Technical Contribution

## 1. Overview of the Contribution

This evidence documents my role as the **designer, architect, and implementer** of the **Enterprise Risk Intelligence Engine**, an applied AI system that converts raw operational event data into **quantified, explainable, and decision-ready enterprise risk intelligence**.

The system is **publicly deployed and operational**, demonstrating real-world applicability beyond research or prototypes.

## 2. Problem Being Addressed (Market Need)

Enterprise organisations face persistent challenges in risk management:

- Operational data exists in large volumes but lacks actionable insight  
- Risk scores are often opaque and non-explainable  
- Audit, compliance, and leadership teams require **narrative justification**, not raw metrics  
- Existing tools prioritise dashboards over decision support  

This creates a gap between **data availability** and **risk-informed decision-making**.

---

## 3. My Technical Contribution

I independently:

- Designed the end-to-end risk intelligence pipeline  
- Defined risk feature engineering and KRI computation logic  
- Implemented anomaly estimation and composite risk scoring  
- Built an explainable narrative reporting layer  
- Deployed the system as a live production service  

The solution moves beyond static analysis to **dynamic, explainable enterprise risk scoring**.

## 4. System Architecture & Workflow

**Input:**  
- CSV files containing operational events, incidents, or logs  

**Processing Pipeline:**  
1. Data validation and cleansing  
2. Feature aggregation and enrichment  
3. Key Risk Indicator (KRI) computation  
4. Statistical anomaly estimation  
5. Composite enterprise risk score generation  
6. Automated plain-English risk narrative  

**Output:**  
- Overall risk score (0–100)  
- Risk classification (Low / Medium / High)  
- KRI breakdown  
- Explainable drivers of risk  
- Executive-ready narrative report  
- Downloadable scored dataset  

This full pipeline is demonstrable via the live system.

## 5. Evidence of Innovation (OC2)

The innovation lies in **how risk intelligence is presented and operationalised**, not merely in modelling.

Key differentiators:

- Explainability-first design (no black-box scoring)  
- Governance-aligned metrics suitable for audit and compliance  
- Human-readable narrative generation for executives  
- Practical enterprise workflows over academic modelling  

This reflects how AI systems are realistically adopted inside regulated organisations.

---

## 6. Evidence of Impact

- The system is publicly deployed and usable without setup  
- Demonstrates applied AI decision intelligence in production  
- Aligns with real enterprise risk and audit workflows  
- Provides a tangible, inspectable artifact for technical review  

The live demo proves **implementation depth**, **technical ownership**, and **practical application**.

## 7. Technical Stack

- Python  
- Pandas / NumPy  
- Streamlit (interactive live interface)  
- Statistical & rule-based risk modelling  
- Explainable narrative generation  
- Render (production deployment)  

---

## 8. Why This Meets Tech Nation Criteria

### Mandatory Criterion (MC)
- Demonstrates leadership through independent design and delivery of a production AI system  
- Shows sustained contribution to applied AI beyond employment  
- Public, inspectable technical work with clear ownership  

### Optional Criterion 2 (OC2)
- Introduces an innovative approach to enterprise risk intelligence  
- Applies AI to a real-world, non-trivial problem  
- Bridges technical modelling with business decision-making

## 10. Summary

The Enterprise Risk Intelligence Engine demonstrates my ability to:

- Identify real enterprise problems  
- Design explainable AI systems  
- Implement end-to-end production solutions  
- Translate complex analytics into decision-ready outputs  

This work reflects the level of **technical excellence, innovation, and leadership** expected under the UK Global Talent (Digital Technology) route.

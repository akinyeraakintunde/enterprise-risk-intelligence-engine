          <!-- Overview -->
          <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">📌 Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Enterprise Risk Intelligence Engine is an <strong>AI-powered system</strong> that ingests
            log data, detects anomalies using machine learning, applies enterprise-ready KRI weighting,
            and generates structured risk reports for cybersecurity, audit and governance teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project demonstrates practical expertise in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Machine learning (Isolation Forest anomaly detection)</li>
            <li>Cybersecurity engineering</li>
            <li>Enterprise risk modelling</li>
            <li>Log processing and risk scoring</li>
            <li>Python software architecture</li>
            <li>Automated reporting and risk intelligence</li>

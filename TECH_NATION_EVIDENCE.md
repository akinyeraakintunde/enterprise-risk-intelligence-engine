# TECH NATION EVIDENCE – Enterprise Risk Intelligence Engine

## Evidence Type  
Technical Contribution – Applied AI, Risk Analytics, and System Design

## Applicant  
Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera

## Overview  
The Enterprise Risk Intelligence Engine is a hybrid rules-based and AI-aware scoring system designed to evaluate enterprise-level risks across financial, operational, compliance, governance, and technology dimensions.  

The system was fully architected and implemented by Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera, with risk-domain review input from Busayo E. Odukoya (Senior Technology Risk Management Analyst, CME Group). It demonstrates technical leadership, end-to-end system engineering, explainable automation, and the ability to translate complex risk frameworks into deployable software.

This project is submitted as part of the Technical Contribution requirement for the UK Global Talent Visa (Digital Technology).

------------------------------------------------------------
## Problem Statement

Many small and medium enterprises do not have consistent risk assessment processes. Common issues include:

- Reliance on spreadsheets and subjective judgement  
- Inconsistent scoring between departments  
- No audit trail or documentation behind decisions  
- Difficulty scaling governance processes  
- No automated or data-driven oversight  

This project provides a structured, configurable, and explainable engine suitable for SMEs, EdTech, immigration advisory businesses, fintech compliance units, and digital governance teams.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Technical Contribution Summary

Ibrahim designed and implemented all core technical components:

1. **Architectural Design**
   - Hybrid scoring model (rules + optional machine learning).
   - Domain-based scoring system (governance, technology, financial, compliance).
   - YAML-driven configuration for weights, thresholds, and rules.
   - Clear module separation for risk_engine, reporting, CLI entrypoints.

2. **Implementation**
   - Coded all scoring logic, rule evaluation, and aggregation.
   - Implemented CLI interface for scoring CSV-based risk registers.
   - Added narrative-driven reporting for transparency and audit readiness.
   - Developed extensible schema for risk profiles and outputs.
   - Created example datasets and configuration files.

3. **Documentation**
   - Full README documentation with architecture, examples, and usage.
   - Diagrams describing scoring flow and engine design.
   - TECH_NATION_EVIDENCE.md for reviewers.
   - Clear explanation of scoring methodology for non-technical users.

4. **Risk Expertise Validation**
   - Architecture and scoring logic reviewed by **Busayo E. Odukoya**,  
     Senior Technology Risk Management Analyst at CME Group.  
   - Busayo provided professional validation and domain alignment.  
   - All engineering and implementation was performed independently by Ibrahim.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Impact

This engine establishes:

- Consistent and automated risk evaluation for SMEs.  
- Explainable scoring for governance, audit, and compliance teams.  
- A template that can evolve into:
  - A FastAPI risk assessment service  
  - Dashboard analytics and live monitoring  
  - Machine-learning augmented models for anomaly detection  

It demonstrates the applicant’s ability to lead complex systems engineering work at the intersection of risk, AI, automation, and digital governance.
